      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <div class="home-page">
        <img src="images/large-wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe" />
        <img src="images/mobile-wireframe.png" alt="mobile wireframe" />
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
